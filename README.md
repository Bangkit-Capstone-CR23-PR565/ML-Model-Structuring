# Description
This ML project is for our final project at Google Bangkit Academy 2023.

**Project Background:**

Currently, there are still many SMEs that have difficulties in promoting their products at events due to the lack of information about suitable events and the costly participation fee, typically in Indonesia. Meanwhile, event organizers also have difficulties finding suitable SMEs to be included in the events held. This project will answer the research question by building an application that can connect SMEs with event organizers effectively and efficiently.

**Machine Learning** 

In this project we have made two recommendation models and a data scraper:
- Tags Recommendation model

    This model recommends events to user based on search query of events tags.

- User Recommendation model

    This model recommends events to user based on user data.

- Scraper

    This script is used to parse and gather data using a web scraper library.
